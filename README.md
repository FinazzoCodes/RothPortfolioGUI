# RothPortfolioGUI
I've created a tool in C# that helps you manage your investments in two index funds, FZROX and FZILX, using a 70/30 allocation strategy. It's important to note that this is not financial advice, but rather a tool that helps me invest with Fidelity and may be helpful for those with similar goals. 

## Future Plans
At the moment this program is mostly built to help me invest in my Roth IRA and others with similar investing goals as me, but I'd like to change that. I'd like to add a features that give the user more freedom, I've listed some of my goals below.
* Convert program to OOP                                                                                                      - unfinshed
* Add a feature that shows how much money is available to invest after total pay calculations                                 - unfinshed
* Add an adjustment that allows user to add their own custom investment funds and custom percentage to go into those funds    - unfinshed
* Add a PIE Chart that shows how much money went into each fund                                                               - unfinshed
